# Marvel code test

The task is to create a simple image zoom app. It should take around 2-3 hours so please don't spend excessive amounts of time on it.

This prototype, https://marvelapp.com/122ch4h/, shows how the app should work.

## Specification
* the image should be centred in the viewport
* the image should initially render at the zoom level that fits the image to the viewport, or 100% if the whole image fits
* the controls should allow zooming in and out in 5% increments
* the maximum zoom should be 100%
* the minimum zoom should be 50%

## Implementation
The app should be implemented in React. You are free to use any starter project or boilerplate and any library (except anything that already includes an image zoom component!). The only requirement is that we can checkout your repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`.
