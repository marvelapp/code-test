# Marvel code test
The task is to create a simple image zoom app with React.

It should take around 2-3 hours so please don't spend excessive amounts of time on it.

This [prototype](https://marvelapp.com/122ch4h/) shows how the app should work.

Don't worry about styling, we're more interested in correct functionality and the quality of the code.

## Specification
* it should centre the image in the viewport
* the image should be centred in the viewport
* it should initially render the image at the zoom level that fits the image to the viewport, or 100% if the whole image fits
* it should allow zooming in and out in 5% increments
* it should zoom in to a maximum of 100%
* it should zoom out to a minimum of 50%
* it should allow selection of any of the 3 sample images provided

## Implementation
The only stipulation is that you build the app in React (or a compatible library if you've been using, say, preact or inferno). Beyond that, you are free to use any library (except anything that already implements an image zoom component!).

Please provide simlpe instructions with your submission on how to run your app.
